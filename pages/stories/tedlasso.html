  <h1> Ted Lasso </h1>
  <p>
    Ted Lasso is something completely different than the other two stories I've mentioned. Initially seeming like a comedy, it tackles real problems that very few stories do in a narrative centered around football and a single club. The characters are endlessly entertaining but grow in a wawy that makes you want to see more and more of their journey.
