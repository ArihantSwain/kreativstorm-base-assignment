  <h1> Guitar </h1>
  <p>
    I picked up guitar around the fourth grade due to a love of a certain character who single-handedly convinced me that the instrument was the only one I'd like to play. I played in various concert halls while I was younger--my brother would play piano at these very same halls--and loved the feeling. I've dropped off the hobby in recent time, but still love guitar.
